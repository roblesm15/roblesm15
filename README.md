### Hola 👋

Thanks for visiting my profile! 

- 📚 I currently am a first year Biostatistics PhD student at Harvard University. 
- 👩🏻‍💻 Before embarking on a PhD journey I worked as a data scientist for the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH). It was a very enriching experience that helped me learn a lot about managing and wrangling huge amounts of data. 
- 📄 Here is a recent publication product of the work done at PRDH: **https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(22)00029-1/fulltext**
- 📫 you can reach me at mroblesfontan@g.harvard.edu
